### Guide

#### Installation:

1. Install Mujoco and SimulationFramework as described in [SimulationFramework](https://github.com/ALRhub/SimulationFramework)
2. For door and soccer tasks:
   1. Copy necessary object files and textures from [Meta-World](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Metaworld) to `SimulationFramework/models/mujoco/objects`
   2. Copy xml files from `objects` folder to `SimulationFramework/models/mujoco/objects`
   3. Fill out correct path to your installation of `SimulationFramework` in the Python files in `objects`
3. For experiments: `pip install cw2`, documentation at [cw2](https://github.com/ALRhub/cw2)
